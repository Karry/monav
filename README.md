# MoNav

This is fork of original [MoNav](https://code.google.com/p/robertvoigt-monav) project (MObile NAvigation).

Goal of this fork is bring Monav back to life (last commit in google-code repository is from year 2012) 
and provide builds for current Linux distros and Jolla smartphone.

Keep in mind that there are more active Monav forks:

 - https://github.com/M4rtinK/monav-light
 - https://github.com/tunp/monavsailfish
 - ...

I want to upgrade all parts of Monav to Qt5 and switch build system to CMake first. 
When it will be compilable I will try to merge updates from active forks 
and I will try to contact active developers...
